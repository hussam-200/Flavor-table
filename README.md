# Flavor-table


### How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

<p>It took me approximately two full days to complete the assignment — one day was dedicated to building and testing the backend (server setup, routes, CORS, API integration), and the second day was spent on the frontend (layout, styling, and dynamic data rendering).</p>

<p>Yes, the most challenging part was working with the external API. Handling API responses, dealing with CORS restrictions, and making sure the data was properly fetched on the backend and displayed correctly on the frontend took extra time and debugging.</p>
